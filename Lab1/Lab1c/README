This is part 1c of the lab.

For lab 1c, we implemented the remaining flag, --profile.

This part of the lab was fairly easy to implement as it just involved adding a getrusage call to each option flag and each command. 

I had trouble with the getrusage when actually performing benchmark tests however. The time values would not be consistent and would occasionally be 0 and sometimes negative. I went to OH for this issue and TAs were also not able to resolve it. To turn it on time and focus on the midterm, I used the times command to get values for the benchmark tests in bash, dash and simpsh.

I also had a small issue with the sanity check and benchmark tests. My code ran with the sanity check when I commented a for loop at line 548-551 in lab1c.c. However, I would have to uncomment this for loop to have my code be able to run the benchmark tests. This issue is also unresolved and I am not quite sure why it behaves this way.

I have turned in the version of code that passes all the sanity check cases provided by the TA.
