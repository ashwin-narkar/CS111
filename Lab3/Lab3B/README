The submission tarball provided contains the following files

lab3b.py:	Analyzes a given .csv file(supposedly generated from lab 3a) with a file summary and determines the file system's validity and correctness
Makefile:	Creates an executable file called lab3b from the lab3b.py script by creating a link to it
README:		Includes descriptions of included files

Lab3b has us analyze a given file system to check if it has any problems which could lead to corrupted files. 
We evaluate a given csv file which contains a summary of the file system contents. 
It was quite difficult to determine the accuracy of our program. My script passes the sanity check.
I used Python because it is simple to write. I used the csvreader library in Python to read the csv files.
